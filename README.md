# ChatGPT_assistance

## Requirements
* OpenAI account
* Get a ChatGPT session token. Tutorial on how to acquire a token can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/chatgpt-api/
* Required Python packages: tkinter, ChatGPT
* Internet access

## How to use it
* Before starting, create a .env file and write down the session token like so: chatgpt_key="your_session_token"
* The script will only work for Python. If you want to use another language replace the word "Python" in line 23 with your programming language of choice.
* Be aware that you only have a certain number of requests availble per hour (~ 50)

## Next steps
* Let the Python code be executed
* Nicer UI
* Requests can build upon the previous ones
* Handle files, web scraping inputs, etc.
* Write a program that makes me a millionaire over night ;)

Enjoy and please give me feedback!
